<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project aims to developing the math quiz application. While developing the application, I was thinkning about the way of perform this website on both mobile OS. Register the application needs to pay the fee on both side. Therefore, I decide to make it web application is because the program can run on both ios and android OS. Math problems are from the open source math quiz website. I collected them by using the beautiful soup and sort data in json file so I can easily load them to the website.
